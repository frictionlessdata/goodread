> This software is in the early stages and not well tested

Goodread executes Python and Bash codeblocks in Markdown and writes the results back.

## Purpose

- **Write your documentation**: You can write Python and Bash codeblocks in your Markdown documentation without executing it. Goodread will run them and add or update the results in-line.
- **Test your documentation**: It's commonplace when documentation gets buggy and outdated during software development. You can incorporate Goodread into your testing system to ensure correctness of your documentation.

## Features

- Solves one problem well
- Simple command-line interface
